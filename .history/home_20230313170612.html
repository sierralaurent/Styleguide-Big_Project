              short quiz to help users realize the severity of their misuse. It
              also includes points to help users understand that substance

              <br/>
              The New-Habits web app will ask users a series of questions,
              narrowing down their substance misuse to a level of severe to
              not-severe and how they can seek help and support from a trained
              professional. Questions include asking if they have noticed any
              financial problems, health concerns and any troubles in personal
              and romantic relationships. When users answer these questions,
              they will then open their eyes and realize how their substance
              misuse is effecting themselves and others. After completion of the
              mini-quiz, the Web-app will then provide resources for the user to
              seek out help from trained professionals, and where they can learn
              more about substance addiction and misuse.

              this app for my own friend and family one day. I hope this
              web-app can help as many people as possible struggling with
              substance misuse, and let them know that this app is a safe
              space to admit you need help and find it.
