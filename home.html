            The New Habits Web-App is for people who have been struggling with
            substance misuse, and think they may be nearing the point of no
            return. This app has been designed tho help those, by including a
            short quiz to help users realize the severity of their misuse. It
            also includes points to help users understand that substance misuse
            not only effects them, but their family and friends. New Habits end
            goal is to help it’s users and get them into their recovery journey,
            by providing a informational web-app as their zero-judgment safe
            zone.
            <br />
            <br />
            The New-Habits web app will ask users a series of questions,
            narrowing down their substance misuse to a level of severe to
            not-severe and how they can seek help and support from a trained
            professional. Questions include asking if they have noticed any
            financial problems, health concerns and any troubles in personal and
            romantic relationships. When users answer these questions, they will
            then open their eyes and realize how their substance misuse is
            effecting themselves and others. After completion of the mini-quiz,
            the Web-app will then provide resources for the user to seek out
            help from trained professionals, and where they can learn more about
            substance addiction and misuse.

              I'm passionate about creating meaningful solutions and excited to
              work on an app dedicated to helping people overcome substance
              abuse. I'm well-versed in programming languages like HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, Python, etc. and design tools like Illustrator and
              Figma. Also, I focus on user-centred designs to create an
              intuitive, easy-to-use app that exceeds our users' expectations.

              As a student growing up in surrey, I've witnessed many people
              using and being addicted to drugs. I pity them but have no way of
              helping them. However, with this web-app, it might be a solution
              to help drug users to hopefully find a way to escape their drug
              addictions and live a cleaner, drug-free life.

              At 22 years old, I have always tried my best to help struggling
              friends and family with substance misuse. I cannot wait to use
              this app for my own friend and family one day. I hope this web-app
              can help as many people as possible struggling with substance
              misuse, and let them know that this app is a safe space to admit
              you need help and find it.
